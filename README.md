Out-of-contest js1k game


Status
------

This is not actually a js1k submission as no compo is held now (november, 2013). Furthermore, it was not even checked by anyone from js1k.

But this code is (hopefully) compliant with [the rules](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/rules) and might pass the submission if only I had time machine.

In two words, I publish this code because I have already made it and waiting for the next compo is so boring.


Compatibility
-------------

Code was tested in latest Chrome, Firefox and Opera/Presto.


Plot
----

You are a pilot of experimental Gravity Variable War Vehicle in space. Your weapon is a huge ball made of tungsten, magic and quantum mechanics. Your goal is to destroy... err.. glowing boxes... Who cares about the plot anyway?


Controls
--------

Move mouse to control gravity center. Hold left mouse button to activate gravitational pull.

This might be tricky at first, but I bet, you can handle it in a few minutes.

Ball may leave the screen bottom, but do not keep it there for too long as it will be lost.


Play!
